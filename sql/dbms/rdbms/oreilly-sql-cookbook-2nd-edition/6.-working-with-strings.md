# 6. Working with Strings

{% hint style="danger" %}
SQL is not designed to perform complex string manipulation

## Walking a String

We want to traverse a string to return each character as a row.

```
-- Oracle
WITH employee_name AS (
    SELECT 'Sundar' AS FIRST_NAME FROM DUAL
)
SELECT SUBSTR(FIRST_NAME, LEVEL, 1) AS CHARACTER
FROM employee_name
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= LENGTH(FIRST_NAME);

-- Oracle
SELECT SUBSTR(FIRST_NAME, LEVEL, 1) AS CHARACTER
FROM employees
WHERE FIRST_NAME = 'Sundar'
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= LENGTH(FIRST_NAME) AND PRIOR FIRST_NAME = FIRST_NAME AND PRIOR DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE IS NOT NULL;
```

## Embedding Quotes Within String Literals

We want to embed quote marks within string literals.

<pre><code><strong>-- Oracle
</strong><strong>select 'g''day mate' qmarks from dual union all
</strong>select 'beavers'' teeth' from dual union all
select '''' from dual
</code></pre>

```
select '''' as quote from dual;
```

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Counting the Occurrences of a Character in a String

We want to count the number of times a character or substring occurs within a given string. Consider the following string. We want to determine how many commas are in the string.

`10,CLARK,MANAGER`&#x20;

```
-- Using length
select (length('10,CLARK,MANAGER')-length(replace('10,CLARK,MANAGER',',','')))/length(',') as cnt
from dual

-- Traversing through each character
WITH sample_string AS (
    SELECT '10,CLARK,MANAGE,R' AS str FROM DUAL
)
select count(substr(str,LEVEL,1)) from sample_string where substr(str,LEVEL,1) = ','
connect by LEVEL < LENGTH(str) ; 
```

## Removing Unwanted Characters from a String

We want to remove specific characters from data. For example, we want to remove all zeros and vowels.

```
select ename,
replace(translate(ename,'aaaaa','AEIOU'),'a','') as stripped1,
sal,
replace(cast(sal as char(4)),'0','') as stripped2
from emp;

-- MySQL does not support TRANSLATE function, so several calls to REPLACE needed
select ename,
replace(
 replace(
  replace(
   replace(
    replace(ename,'A',''),'E',''),'I',''),'O',''),'U','')
as stripped1,
sal,
replace(sal,0,'') stripped2
from emp;
```

## Separating Numeric and Character Data

We have numeric data stored with character data together in one column. We want to separate the character data from the numeric data.

**Sample Data**

SMITH800 \
ALLEN1600 \
WARD1250 \
JONES2975

**Sample Output**

ENAME  SAL\
SMITH    800 \
ALLEN    1600 \
WARD     1250 \
JONES    2975

```
select 
  replace(translate(data,'0123456789','0000000000'),'0') ename,
  to_number(replace(translate(lower(data),'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',rpad('z',26,'z')),'z')) sal
from (
select ename||sal data
from emp
)
```
