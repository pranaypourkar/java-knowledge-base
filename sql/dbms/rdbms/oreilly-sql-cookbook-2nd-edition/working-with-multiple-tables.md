# Working with Multiple Tables

## Stacking One Rowset atop Another (Union All)

We want to return data stored in more than one table, conceptually stacking one result set atop the other. The tables do not necessarily have a common key, but their columns do have the same data types. For example

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (95).png" alt="" width="199"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

```
select ename as ename_and_dname, deptno from emp where deptno = 10
union all
select '----------', null from t1
union all
select dname, deptno from dept;
```

{% hint style="info" %}
UNION ALL will include duplicates if they exist. If we want to filter out duplicates, use the UNION operator. It uses distinct to filter duplicate record.
{% endhint %}

## Joins

Joins are used to combine data from multiple tables based on a related column. They allow you to retrieve comprehensive information that spans across different tables.
