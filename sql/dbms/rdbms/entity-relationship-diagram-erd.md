# Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## Description

An Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram is a type of flowchart that visually represents the entities (real-world objects) and their relationships within a database system. It's a conceptual modeling tool that helps database designers understand and plan the structure of a database before they create the physical tables and columns. ER diagrams help to explain the logical structure of databases.

ER diagrams are created based on three basic concepts: <mark style="background-color:yellow;">entities, attributes and relationships</mark>. ER Diagrams contain different symbols. The purpose of ER Diagram is to represent the entity framework infrastructure.
