# Project Reactor



{% hint style="info" %}
Difference between ProjectReactor.io vs Spring WebFlux?

**Project Reactor** serves as a general-purpose reactive library providing support for asynchronous programming, error handling, backpressure, and a wide range of operators. It operates on a lower level compared to Spring WebFlux, similar to Java 8 Streams and Optional but with added capabilities for reactive programming.

Spring **WebFlux**, on the other hand, is a framework specifically designed for creating reactive web services. It leverages reactive libraries like Project Reactor (or even RxJava) to offer high scalability with low resource usage. While it utilizes Project Reactor under the hood, its primary focus is on providing tools and abstractions for building reactive web applications, handling HTTP requests, and managing resources efficiently.
