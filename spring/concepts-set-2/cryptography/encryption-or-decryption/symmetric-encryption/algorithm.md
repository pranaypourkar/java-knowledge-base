## About

Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption. They are known for their speed and efficiency, making them suitable for encrypting large amounts of data. They heavily rely on mathematical principles and operations to secure data.&#x20;

These algorithms can be divided into **block ciphers** and **stream ciphers**.

Mathematical Techniques Commonly Used by the Algorithms are

* Substitution and Permutation
* Finite Fields (Galois Fields) - (**Used In AES**)
* Bitwise Operations
* Modular Arithmetic
* S-boxes (Substitution Boxes) - (**Used In DES, AES**)
* P-boxes (Permutation Boxes) - (**Used in DES**)
* Linear and Non-linear Mixing
